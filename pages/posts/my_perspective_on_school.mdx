Just today I was thinking in my shower about a recurring problem I see in society and face myself as a student: The workings of school and its system.

I'd like to let it be known I don't really endorse my school system that well, I'd say I'm, in fact, quite opposed to it. I can see ways to better it, and I don't give any hope on the existing ones. I hope that, in the future, school systems become a discipline and a matter of worry, just like lots of equally interesting and chaotic fields that today exist. Unfortunately, I don't believe I'll ever see that happening.

Why do I not believe in our current system, and why do I not believe it'll get better? Well, allow me to explain. Let's, first, approach the former one: Why I do not have hope on our current educational system.

## Why I do not believe in our school system

### It's boring and time consuming

I've met few students who genuinely liked school. The majority of them hates it. Nonetheless, I believe it's a widely accepted fact, especially for the ones who suffer it on their skin, that school gives a lot of stress in your daily life. It takes a lot of your time with extracurricular activities, and, depending on the country you're in, you might spend more time in school than you would spend on a 9 to 5 job, such as the one I'm in.

You don't even get to do something you would find meaningful or fun. Just like a robot[^1], you'll have to stay quiet and orderly locked in a room where you will spend the majority of your time, learning about subjects you won't use anytime soon or perhaps won't even use at all. Eventually, you'll get some sort of pass which tells you can take a break and use the bathroom for a few minutes, to then again repeat this same cycle. All day, five days per week, every term, every year. Endlessly. With no freedom or reasoning whatsoever.

### It (arguably) does not prioritize what should be prioritized

As an adult, you will probably want to know about topics such as how to do your taxes, how to get out of the rat race, how to project and speak better, in order to have better relationships with people. How to become a better individual, how to start investing and even creating your own enterprise. I say this because it's something senseful and logical, it's part of the curiosity of today's children, and of the needs of tomorrow's society. Plus, I had the majority of these questions myself. Unfortunately, such won't be answered by school. Those are thing you either learn with life by yourself, or won't learn at all. The type of things that could save and improve your life directly, and make you a richer, more ethical, more responsible, and overall more conscious human being.

None of this is covered necessarily in some stage in your life. Therefore, not everyone will have sense and answers regarding this. Of course, such situation leads to poor habits and minds, an uninterested, uncultured society, and more criminality. This can easily be proven by taking a look at today's society: The average Joe isn't cultured, nor does he care about such topic. He does not know neither does he care about the politics and philosophies influencing himself and his daily life. He works a dead-end, 9 to 5 job, where he probably isn't very happy. He probably hates his job and boss, and believes all rich people are terrible, that money is a sure way to disgrace, and that wealth is fixed and stagnated.

This is, of course, quite obviously a stereotype, which won't always be real, but which will, however, sum up a large part of the population. This is how my parents think, for the majority of it. Not just my parents, but the biggest part of people surrounding me. I've seen it all happen over and over again. Of course, I do not want to end up the same way, and that is what I am and have been striving for, since a couple of years back then. I often read books regarding this and other topics, and I really enjoyed Rich Dad Poor Dad. I really recommend reading it. It really opens your eyes regarding this subject.

## Why I do not believe our school system will ever become what it should become

Alright. For the first part, I believe it has been, on the least, reasonably covered. Let me, now, try to address the second part regarding my argument, which envolves on the school system's evolution in a longer term. This can probably reason on why it hasn't evolved in a century, and still won't in the future, if my predictions are correct, which I really hope they aren't.

### It's not something appliable to the masses

The core and first problem I see regarding this idea, is the fact that all of us want to, of course, live a good life. None of us want to do the hardest jobs, which also happen to be, arguably, the ones with the poorest conditions and, often, the lowest salaries. Well, if we all succeed in a school system which prioritizes these dreams and objectives of ours, the masses wouldn't have anyone to take care of these hardest jobs, that, as said previously, are the ones no one wants to do at first glance, but that all of us depend on.

Note that this is said in a very relative note: When I speak about hardest jobs, I'm not necessarily talking about cashiers, masons and what not. It might be a relatively speaking much better job. But it's probably not the equivalent of the job of your dreams. Of what you really would like to do.

The bottom line in this point is that, if everyone was taught and helped to do what they really want to do, there would be no one to do what no one wants to do. And these jobs are crucial in our society, at least at the moment. The workers are at the lowest end of the hierarchical pyramid, but are also the most dependable and crucial ones.

### The upper forces do not want intelligent underdogs

It's quite literally what's said in the title. If everyone went through a school system which made us intelligent, the powerful ones would have no power against us. A master has no power opposed to a group of truly intelligent, united and fearless slaves. They wouldn't be slaves anymore. If you're the powerful in a divided and mediocre society, you have nothing to fear. If they're ignorant, thinking they are intelligent and actually dictate and rule the society, when they aren't and they don't, you have even more control.

[^1]: This remotes to the industrial age, and on how in said age it was required lots of obedient, machine-like factory workers to produce in mass. With innovation, more and more we value other qualities, such as imagination, vision and creativity. A lot changed in a century. This cannot be said about school. We still force children to work and grow obediently and fake it as "education", when this is not the type of civilization our times require at the moment.
